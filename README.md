## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🐳 Docker (Recommended)
The Docker image includes EasyProxy plus integrated CF Turnstile Solver for maximum compatibility. 

To run the container and persist config/recordings on your host machine, mount the `/data` directory:

```bash
docker run -d -p 7860:7860 -v ./data:/data --name EasyProxy ghcr.io/realbestia1/easyproxy:latest
```

### 🐍 Python (Local)

#### Prerequisites (All Platforms)
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Git** (for cloning dependencies)

#### 🪟 Windows Setup
The easiest way to get EasyProxy plus solvers on Windows:
1. Clone the repository and enter the folder.
2. Run **`start_full.bat`**.
*This script automatically handles CF Turnstile Solver, patches, and dependencies.*

#### 🐧 Linux / macOS Setup
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python -m playwright install chromium
   ```
2. **Start EasyProxy**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
#### 📱 Termux (Android)
EasyProxy plus solvers is fully supported on Android via Termux + Ubuntu proot.

Android users can also install the APK build if they prefer a simpler app-style setup. The APK is convenient, but it is not as complete as the Python/Termux version, so Termux remains the recommended option for full functionality.

For Termux, full functionality requires a 64-bit Android device. On 32-bit devices, some components and solvers may not work.

1.  **Install Termux** from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) (do NOT use Play Store version).
2.  **Run the One-Shot Setup**:
    ```bash
    curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realbestia1/EasyProxy/main/termux_setup.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash
    ```
3.  **Prevent Termux from Sleeping**:
    - **Wake Lock**: Swipe down your notification bar and click **"Acquire wake-lock"** on the Termux notification.
    - **Battery Optimization**: Go to your Phone Settings -> Apps -> Termux -> Battery -> Set to **"Unrestricted"**.
4.  **Commands**:
    - `easyproxy`: Start the full stack.
    - `easyproxy-update`: Update code and dependencies.
    - `easyproxy-stop`: Stop all services.

*Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:7860`*

## ⚙️ Configuration

Most configuration settings (including Cloudflare WARP, DVR, and Proxy settings) are now managed directly from the **Admin Panel** at `http://localhost:7860/admin`.

Only basic environment variables need to be set in your `.env` file or container settings:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PORT` | Server port | `7860` |
| `API_PASSWORD` | Password to protect the proxy API and admin panel | `ep` |

### 🛡️ Cloudflare WARP Integration
The Docker image includes an integrated Cloudflare WARP client to bypass IP-based blocks.

You can enable and configure WARP, customize the excluded domains list, and enter your license key directly from the **Admin Panel**.

## 📖 API Usage
For detailed API documentation and testing, use the built-in **Interactive Docs** available at:
- `http://localhost:7860/docs` (Swagger UI)
- `http://localhost:7860/redoc` (ReDoc)

### 📺 Streaming Proxy
Prefix any stream URL with the proxy endpoint to handle headers and DRM.
```
http://localhost:7860/proxy/manifest.m3u8?url=<URL>
```
**Options:**
- `&clearkey=KID:KEY`: Provide keys for DASH streams.
- `&warp=off`: Force the request to bypass the WARP VPN and use the server's real IP (Direct Connection).
- `&h_<Header Name>=<Value>`: Pass custom headers (e.g., `&h_User-Agent=VLC`).

### 🔍 Stream Extractor
Extract direct video links from supported websites.
```
http://localhost:7860/extractor/video?d=<URL>&redirect_stream=true
```
*Tip: Open `http://localhost:7860/extractor` in your browser for a list of all parameters and supported hosts.*

### 📼 DVR & Recordings
Manage your recordings via the `/recordings` web UI or API.
- `/record?url=<URL>&name=<NAME>`: Start recording and watch simultaneously.
- `/api/recordings/start`: Trigger a background recording.
